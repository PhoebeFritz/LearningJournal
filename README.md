I started to work on my first tutorial properly after a couple of weeks progcrastination and focusing on other modules. This was difficult as not only was coding new to me but i also felt being on the fifth week of the semester, i felt i was unbelievable behind and needed to rush to catch up. I learnt that API Dictionary hdoes not have all termonology in as some of it depends on C# and the terminology used specific with the program. I also found out about DotNet website to help find these programe specific terms wth help from Paul, our teacher for this module. I started by looking at the tutorials Paul had made and used it as a reference for formating my tutorials, but also to breakdown the coding he had done as a basis of looking at what each word and term meant in C# to help my learning and understanding of the code.

I went to the Games Lab woth Olivia and Isaac to work on my tutorials with that aim to help focus while working which would be difficult at home on our PC's and Laptops. I continued to breakdown all of Pauls code in order to understand it.
